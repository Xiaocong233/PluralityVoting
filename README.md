# PluralityVoting
This my program created for new 2020cs50x pset3, it takes at max 9 numbers of candidates as command line arguments, then it prompts the user for a number of votes going to all candidates, then it prompts the users to enter the amount of votes going into those candidates. Consequently, user should be then be able to enter in a name for each vote. The program at last would calculate who would be the winner(s) for the round.

If a tie occurs, both the candidates would be considered winners.
