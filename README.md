## Description
This my program created for new 2020 cs50x pset3, it takes at max 9 numbers of candidates as command line arguments, then it prompts the user for a number of votes going to all candidates, then it prompts the users to enter the amount of votes going into those candidates. Consequently, user should be then be able to enter in a name for each vote. The program at last would calculate who would be the winner(s) for the round.

If a tie occurs, both the candidates would be considered winners.

## Usage
```
$ make plurality
$ ./plurality [candidate ...] //input name of candidates, up to 9 candidates
Number of voters: number # all positive integers
Vote: candidate's name # must correspond to the initial commandline input
```

## What I have learned
* Building and using structs in C, first experience with class-like data structures in programming
* Comparing strings
